# Fraud Detection Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing financial transaction data to detect fraudulent activities. The dataset contains various types of transactions, and the goal is to explore the data, perform visualizations, and build machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

---

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizations of transaction types using bar plots and pie charts.
  - Analysis of metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for different models.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Implementation of models such as **Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier**.
  - Comparison of model performance using metrics.
## Conclusion
 The Decision Tree model shows the most balanced performance with respect to precision and recall, followed by the MLP. Logistic Regression performs poorly in correctly identifying positive instances despite its high accuracy.
